# Culture

Much of this document was taken from Reed Hasting's excellent work on company culture at Netflix. Many thanks to him for publishing that work.

## Company Culture  Statements are Usually Bullshit!

The foundation of Next Glass culture is freedom & responsibility. *We seek excellence*, so our culture is focused on achieving excellence.

## Six Aspects of Our Culture
1. Values are what we value
2. High performance 
3. Freedom & responsibility
4. Context, not control
5. Pay top of market
6. Promotions & development 

## Values are what we value

Many companies have nice sounding value statements displayed on the wall in their lobby, such as:
* Integrity
* Respect
* Communication
* Excellence

Enron had these values displayed in their lobby.

> ..the actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.

Actual company values are the behaviors and skills that we particularly value in fellow employees.

## Values
At Next Glass, we particularly value the following 9 behaviors and skills in our colleagues (meaning we hire and promote
people who demonstrate these nine):
* Judgment
* Communication
* Impact
* Curiosity
* Innovation
* Courage
* Passion
* Honesty
* Selflessness

####Judgement
* You make wise decisions (people, technical, business, and creative) despite ambiguity. 
* You identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms.
* You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do.
* You smartly separate what must be done well now, and what can be improved later.

####Communication
* You listen well, instead of reacting fast, so you can better understand. 
* You are concise and articulate in speech and writing.
* You treat people with respect independent of their status or disagreement with you.
* You maintain calm poise in stressful situations.

####Impact
* You accomplish amazing amounts of important work.
* You demonstrate consistently strong performance so colleagues can rely upon you.
* You focus on great results rather than on process.
* You exhibit bias-to-action, and avoid analysis-paralysis.

####Curiosity
* You learn rapidly and eagerly.
* You seek to understand our strategy, market, and customers.
* You are generally knowledgeable about business, technology, and beer & wine.
* You contribute effectively outside of your specialty.

####Innovation
* You rethink issues to discover practical solutions to hard problems.
* You challenge prevailing assumptions when warranted, and suggest better approaches.
* You create new and valuable ideas.
* You keep us nimble by minimizing complexity and working hard to simplify.

####Courage
* You say what you think even if it is controversial. 
* You make tough decisions without excessive agonizing. 
* You take smart risks and are not afraid to fail.
* You question actions that are inconsistent with our values.

####Passion
* You inspire others with your drive for excellence.
* You celebrate wins.
* You are resilient.
* You care intensely about the success of Next Glass.

####Honesty
* You are known for candor and directness.
* You are non-political when you disagree with others.
* You only say things about fellow employees that you would say to their face.
* You are quick to admit mistakes.

####Selflessness
* You seek what is best for Next Glass, rather than best for yourself or your group.
* You are ego-less when searching for the best ideas.
* You make time to help colleagues.
* You share information openly and proactively.

##High Performance
Imagine if every person at Next Glass is someone you respected and learned from. *It would be an awesome place to work.*

**Great Workplace is about Awesome Colleagues.** Great workplace is not about espresso bars, nice offices, game rooms, sushi lunches, etc. We do some of these things, but only if they lead to attracting and keeping awesome colleagues.

Like every company, we try to hire well. But, unlike many companies, we practice *“adequate” performance equals a fair severance package.*

We’re a team, not a family. We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team. Next Glass leaders  hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.

####The Keeper Test For Leaders
Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving would I fight hard to keep at Next Glass?

This means:
> The other people should get a fair severance now, so we can open a slot to try to find a star for that role.

####Honesty always.
* As a leader, no one in your group should be materially surprised of your views.
* Candor is not just a leader’s responsibility, and you should periodically ask your manager: “If I told you I was leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind?

####All of Us are Responsible for Ensuring We Live Our Values
* You question actions inconsistent with our values” is part of the Courage Value.
* Akin to the honor code pledge: *“I will not lie, nor cheat, nor steal, nor tolerate those who do.”*

####Corporate Team
* The more talent we have, the more we can accomplish, so our people assist each other all the time
* Internal “cutthroat” or “sink or swim” behavior is rare and not tolerated

>We help each other to be great.
