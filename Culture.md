# Culture

Much of this document was taken from Reed Hasting's excellent work on company culture at Netflix. Many thanks to him for publishing that work.

## Company Culture Statements are Usually Bullshit.

This document is no exception. Unless you believe it. And act on it. The bullshit is always there if you want it to be. The foundation of Next Glass culture is freedom & responsibility. *We seek excellence*, so our culture is focused on achieving excellence.

## Six Aspects of Our Culture
1. Values are what we value
2. High performance 
3. Freedom & responsibility
4. Context, not control
5. Pay top of market
6. Promotions & development 

## Values are what we value

Many companies have nice sounding value statements displayed on the wall in their lobby, such as:
* Integrity
* Respect
* Communication
* Excellence

Enron had these values displayed in their lobby.

> ..the actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.

Actual company values are the behaviors and skills that we particularly value in fellow employees.

## Values
At Next Glass, we particularly value the following 9 behaviors and skills in our colleagues (meaning we hire and promote
people who demonstrate these nine):
* Judgment
* Communication
* Impact
* Curiosity
* Innovation
* Courage
* Passion
* Honesty
* Selflessness

####Judgement
* You make wise decisions (people, technical, business, and creative) despite ambiguity. 
* You identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms.
* You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do.
* You smartly separate what must be done well now, and what can be improved later.

####Communication
* You listen well, instead of reacting fast, so you can better understand. 
* You are concise and articulate in speech and writing.
* You treat people with respect independent of their status or disagreement with you.
* You maintain calm poise in stressful situations.

####Impact
* You accomplish amazing amounts of important work.
* You demonstrate consistently strong performance so colleagues can rely upon you.
* You focus on great results rather than on process.
* You exhibit bias-to-action, and avoid analysis-paralysis.

####Curiosity
* You learn rapidly and eagerly.
* You seek to understand our strategy, market, and customers.
* You are generally knowledgeable about business, technology, and beer & wine.
* You contribute effectively outside of your specialty.

####Innovation
* You rethink issues to discover practical solutions to hard problems.
* You challenge prevailing assumptions when warranted, and suggest better approaches.
* You create new and valuable ideas.
* You keep us nimble by minimizing complexity and working hard to simplify.

####Courage
* You say what you think even if it is controversial. 
* You make tough decisions without excessive agonizing. 
* You take smart risks and are not afraid to fail.
* You question actions that are inconsistent with our values.

####Passion
* You inspire others with your drive for excellence.
* You celebrate wins.
* You are resilient.
* You care intensely about the success of Next Glass.

####Honesty
* You are known for candor and directness.
* You are non-political when you disagree with others.
* You only say things about fellow employees that you would say to their face.
* You are quick to admit mistakes.

####Selflessness
* You seek what is best for Next Glass, rather than best for yourself or your group.
* You are ego-less when searching for the best ideas.
* You make time to help colleagues.
* You share information openly and proactively.

##High Performance
Imagine if every person at Next Glass is someone you respected and learned from. *It would be an awesome place to work.*

**Great Workplace is about Awesome Colleagues.** Great workplace is not about espresso bars, nice offices, game rooms, sushi lunches, etc. We do some of these things, but only if they lead to attracting and keeping awesome colleagues.

Like every company, we try to hire well. But, unlike many companies, we practice *“adequate” performance equals a fair severance package.*

We’re a team, not a family. We’re like a pro sports team, not a kid’s recreational team. Next Glass leaders  hire, develop and cut smartly, so we have stars in every position.

####The Keeper Test For Leaders
Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving would I fight hard to keep at Next Glass?

This means:
> The other people should get a fair severance now, so we can open a slot to try to find a star for that role.

####Honesty always.
* As a leader, no one in your group should be materially surprised of your views.
* Candor is not just a leader’s responsibility, and you should periodically ask your manager: “If I told you I was leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind?

####All of Us are Responsible for Ensuring We Live Our Values
* You question actions inconsistent with our values” is part of the Courage Value.
* Akin to the honor code pledge: *“I will not lie, nor cheat, nor steal, nor tolerate those who do.”*

####Corporate Team
* The more talent we have, the more we can accomplish, so our people assist each other all the time
* Internal “cutthroat” or “sink or swim” behavior is rare and not tolerated

>We help each other to be great.

What about loyalty? What about hard work? What about the brilliant jerk?

####Loyalty is Good
* Loyalty is good as a stabilizer.
* People who have been stars for us and hit a bad patch get a near term pass because we think they’re likely to become stars for us again.
* We want the same: if Next Glass hits a temporary rough patch, we want people to stick with us.
* But unlimited loyalty to a shrinking firm, or to an ineffective employee, is not what we are about.

####Hard Work – Not Directly Relevant
* We don’t measure people by how many hours they work or how much they are in the office.
* We do care about accomplishing great work.
* Sustained B-level performance, despite “A for effort”, generates a fair severance package with respect.
* Sustained A-level performance, despite minimal effort, is rewarded with more responsibility and great pay.

####Brilliant Jerks
Some companies tolerate them. For us, the cost to teamwork is too high. Diverse styles are fine – as long as the person embodies the 9 values.

####Why are we so insistent on high performance?
In procedural work, the best are 2x better than the average.
In creative/inventive work, *the best are 10x better than the average*, so we place a huge premium on creating effective teams of the best people.
**A great workplace equals Awesome Colleagues.**

##Freedom and Responsibility
*Self motivating
*Self aware
*Self disciplined
*Self improving
*Acts like a leader
*Doesn’t wait to be told what to do
*Picks up the trash lying on the floor

####Responsible People Thrive on Freedom
Our goal and model is to increase employee freedom as we grow, rather than limit it *to continue to attract and nourish innovative people, so that we have a better chance of long-term continued success.*

Most companies curtail freedom in an effort to reduce errors while growing.

In most companies, when growth increases, complexity increases and talent density decreases.

Chaos and errors emerge and spike here as business become too complex to run informally with lower talent level.

Process emerges to stop the chaos. No one loves process, but it feels good compared to the pain of chaos.

Focus on process drives talent out.

####Strong Near-Term Outcome- A highly successful process-driven company
*With leading share in its market.
*Minimal thinking required.
*Few mistakes made – very efficient.
*Few curious innovator-mavericks remain.
*Very optimized processes for the existing market.

####Then the Market Shifts
*Market shifts due to new technology or new competitors or new business models.
*Company is unable to adapt quickly, because the employees are extremely good at following the existing processes, and process adherence is the value system.
*Company generally grinds painfully into irrelevance, due to inability to respond to the market shift.

####Seems Like Three Bad Options
1. Stay creative, by staying small.
2. Try to avoid rules as you grow, suffer through lots of chaos.
4. Use process as you grow to drive efficient execution of current model, but cripple creativity, innovation, flexibility, and ability to thrive when market inevitably shifts.

####A Fourth Option
* Avoid chaos as you grow with Ever More High Performance People – not with Rules.
* Then you can continue to run informally with self-discipline and avoid chaos.
* The run informally part is what enables and attracts creativity.

The key: Increase talent density faster than complexity grows.

####Increase talent density
*Top of market compensation.
*Attract hi-value people through freedom to make an impact.
*Be demanding about high performance culture.

####Minimize Complexity Growth
*Few big products vs many small ones.
*Eliminate distracting complexity (barnacles).
*Value simplicity.

> With the right people, instead of a Culture of process adherence, a culture of freedom and responsibility, innovation and self-discipline.

But is freedom absolute? Are all rules & processes bad?

Freedom is not absolute. Like “free speech” there are some limited exceptions to “freedom at work”.

####Two Types of Necessary Rules
1. Prevent irrevocable disaster
* E.g. Financials produced are wrong
* E.g. Hackers steal our customers’ credit card info
2. Moral, ethical, legal issues
* E.g. Dishonesty, harassment are intolerable

####Mostly Though, Rapid Recovery is the Right Model
* Just fix problems quickly.
* High performers make very few errors.
* We’re in a creative-inventive market, not a safety-critical market like medicine or nuclear power.
* You’ve heard preventing errors is cheaper than fixing them.
* True in manufacturing or medicine, but not so in creative environments.

####Rule Creep
* Bad processes tend to creep in- Preventing errors just sounds so good
* We try to get rid of rules when we can to reinforce the point

####Example: Next Glass Vacation Policy and Tracking*
There is no policy or tracking. There is also no clothing policy at Next Glass, but no one has come to work naked lately. You don’t need detailed policies for everything.

Next Glass’ vacation policy doesn’t mean no vacation.
> Next Glass’ leaders set good examples by taking big vacations – and coming back inspired to find big ideas.

####Another Example of Freedom and Responsibility
Most companies have complex policies around what you can expense, how you travel, what gifts you can accept, etc. Plus they have whole departments to verify compliance with these policies.

Next Glass Policies for Expensing, Entertainment, Gifts & Travel:
    Act in Next Glass’ Best Interests

####Act in Next Glass’ Best Interests Generally Means…
*Expense only what you would otherwise not spend, and is worthwhile for work.
*Travel as you would if it were your own money.
*Disclose non-trivial vendor gifts.
*Take from Next Glass only when it is inefficient to not take, and inconsequential.
*“taking” means, for example, printing personal documents at work or making personal calls on work phone: inconsequential and inefficient to avoid.

####Summary of Freedom & Responsibility
*As we grow, we minimize rules.
*Inhibit chaos with ever more High Performance People.
*Flexibility is more important than efficiency in the long term.

##Context, not Control

>If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders.  Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. Antoine De Saint-Exupery, Author of The Little Prince

The best leaders figure out how to get great outcomes by setting the appropriate context, rather than by trying to control their people. When you believe in context over control, you try to provide the insight and understanding to enable sound decisions.

####With Context
*Strategy
*Metrics
*Assumptions
*Objectives
*Clearly-defined roles 
*Knowledge of the stakes
*Transparency around decision-making

####With Control
*Top-down decision-making
*Management approval
*Committees
*Planning and process valued more than results

####Good Context
*Link to company/functional goals.
*Relative priority (how important/how time sensitive).
*Critical (needs to happen now), or
*Nice to have (when you can get to it).
*Level of precision & refinement.
*No errors (credit cards handling, etc...), or
*Pretty good / can correct errors (website), or.
*Rough (experimental).
*Key stakeholders.
*Key metrics / clear definition of success.

The best leaders figure out how to get great outcomes by setting the appropriate context, rather than by trying to control their people

    Leaders:
    When one of your talented people does something dumb, don’t blame them. Instead, ask yourself what context you failed to set.
    When you are tempted to control people, are you articulate and inspiring enough about your goals and strategies?

##Pay top of market

Paying top of market is core to High Performance Culture. *One outstanding employee gets more done and costs less than two adequate employees.* We endeavor to have only outstanding employees.

####
Three Tests for Top of Market for a Person
*What could the person get elsewhere?
*What would we pay for replacement?
*What would we pay to keep the person if they had a bigger offer elsewhere?

Our goal is to keep each employee at top of market for that person. That means we pay them more than anyone else likely would. We pay them as much as a replacement would cost. We pay them as much as we would pay to keep them if they had higher offer from elsewhere.

####Titles Are Not Very Helpful
*Lots of people have the title “Major League Pitcher” but they are not all equally effective.
*Similarly, all people with the title “Senior Marketing Manager” or “Director of Engineering” are not equally effective.
*So the art of compensation is answering the Three Tests for each employee.

####When Top of Market Comp is Done Right
*We will rarely counter with higher comp when someone is voluntarily leaving because we have already moved comp to our max for that person.
*Employees will feel they are getting paid well relative to their other options in the market.

####It’s Good For Each Employee to Understand Their Market Value
It’s a healthy idea, not a traitorous idea, to understand what other firms would pay you, by interviewing and talking to peers at other companies. Talk with your manager about what you find. *Minor exception: interviewing with groups that directly compete with Next Glass, because their motive is in part confidential information.*

##Promotions and Development
In some time periods, in some groups, there will be lots of opportunity and growth at Next Glass. Some people, through both luck and talent, will have extraordinary career growth.

####Baseball Analogy: Minors to Majors
*Very talented people usually get to move up, but only true for the very talented.
*Some luck in terms of what positions open up and what the competition is.
*Some people move to other teams to get the opportunity they want.
*Great teams keep their best talent.
*Some minor league players keep playing even though they don’t move up because they love the game.


####Two Necessary Conditions for Promotion
1. Job has to be big enough
*We might have an incredible manager of something, but we don’t need a director of it because job isn’t big enough
*If the incredible manager left, we would replace with manager, not with director
2. Person has to be a superstar in current role
* Could get the next level job here if applying from outside and we knew their talents well.
* Could get the next level job at peer firm that knew their talents well.

####Development
We develop people by giving them the opportunity to develop themselves, by surrounding them with awesome colleagues and giving them big challenges to work on. Mediocre colleagues or unchallenging work is what kills progress of a person’s skills.

Individuals should manage their own career paths, and not rely on a corporation for planning their careers. Like retirement planning – it’s more successful when it’s the individual’s responsibility.

>An individual’s economic security is based upon their skills and reputation. We try hard to consistently provide opportunity to grow both.

We need a culture that supports *rapid innovation and excellent execution.* We need a culture that supports *effective teamwork of high-performance people.*

We need a culture that avoids the rigidity, politics, mediocrity, and complacency that infects most organizations as they grow.

####This document is our current best thinking about maximizing our likelihood of continuous success.

Our culture is a work in progress.

Every year we try to refine our culture further as we learn more.
