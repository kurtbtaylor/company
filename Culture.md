# Culture

Much of this document was taken from Reed Hasting's excellent work on company culture at Netflix. Many thanks to him for publishing that work.

## Company Culture  Statements are Usually Bullshit!

The foundation of Next Glass culture is freedom & responsibility.

#### We Seek Excellence

So, our culture is focused on achieving excellence

### Six Aspects of Our Culture
1. Values are what we value
2. High performance 
3. Freedom & responsibility
4. Context, not control
5. Pay top of market
6. Promotions & development 

## Values are what we value

Many companies have nice sounding value statements displayed on the wall in their lobby, such as:
* Integrity
* Respect
* Communication
* Excellence

Enron had these values displayed in their lobby.

> ..the actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.

Actual company values are the behaviors and skills that we particularly value in fellow employees.

## Values
At Next Glass, we particularly value the following 9 behaviors and skills in our colleagues (meaning we hire and promote
people who demonstrate these nine):
* Judgment
* Communication
* Impact
* Curiosity
* Innovation
* Courage
* Passion
* Honesty
* Selflessness

####Judgement
* You make wise decisions (people, technical, business, and creative) despite ambiguity 
* You identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms 
* You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do 
* You smartly separate what must be done well now, and what can be improved later 

####Communication
* You listen well, instead of reacting fast, so you can better understand 
* You are concise and articulate in speech and writing 
* You treat people with respect independent of their status or disagreement with you 
* You maintain calm poise in stressful situations
